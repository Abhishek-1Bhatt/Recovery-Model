# Recovery-Model
Simple Stochastic model to simulate the recovery of a population from epidemic.
- This repository houses a Jupyter Notebook which contains Julia code for simulating the recovery time of each individual in a population from a contagious infection.
- A better look at the notebook can be achieved by downloading it as Github has faulty rendering for Jupyter Notebooks. Besides the most creative and amazing plots toward the end require Interact which won't be rendered outside Jupyter Notebook environment.
- The Julia version used here is 1.6.1.
- Can be run in Jupyter by using ]add IJulia in Julia REPL which gives the option of usin Julia code in Jupyter.
